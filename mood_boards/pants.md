# Zurich Marathon 2026 Campaign

## Theme

A joyful, high-energy campaign for the upcoming Zurich Marathon 2026. The core message: no matter what gear you're wearing, running is fun. Every image should radiate **movement and athleticism** — people mid-stride, sprinting, pushing through the last kilometer. Show the sweat, the grit, the runner's high. Embrace the absurd — these posts should feel crazy, unpredictable, and thought-provoking.

## Products to Consider

SKUs: 1WE30701756, 1WD10570462, 1WF11290069

Use the characters, apparel, and gear visible in the product images as direct references for the generated visuals.

## Visual Direction

- Every scene must be a **lifestyle photo** — real-life situations or street race moments, with subjects **actively running or in motion**
- Every image must include a **dog** and **coffee** somewhere in the frame
- Weave in these keywords as visual or conceptual motifs: **space**, **finish line**, **UFO**
- Go for surreal, playful compositions that stop the scroll

## Tone

Happy, energetic, irreverent. The vibe is "marathon morning meets cosmic chaos." Lean into humor and surprise while keeping it aspirational and on-brand for On. Above all, celebrate the joy of **being active** — the freedom of lacing up and hitting the road.
